Helpme!!!

Priority: High
//1) Wei Hong, how's the GUID?
2) Admin Dashboard System Logs
3) (But do it last) dingtalk, create tickets using dingtalk (using restful)

Priority: Middle
twh1) (Not Sure) Agent User info -> Manage Account -> Manage Access, "Password Reset Required" & "User cannot change password" done??
//2) Try to remove every "Insert Link" and "Insert Image" from textarea/readactor box/wysihtml5, or else there will be backdrop error when you try to insert link or image (insert link -> click on link -> click cancel -> error occured)
(a) Reason: Error occured if there's an href inside button of modal box (eg. <a href="" data-toggle="modal" data-target="">), but there's no way to remove href from these two buttons, so better just remove them off
//jim3) User Ticket - Remove Inventory field and edit ticket button? These information/functions seem useless for me
//jim4) Ticket info, thread entry type = 'E'
twh5) Agent edit thread entry text

Priority: Low
twh1) Agent Dashboard: Graph unprepared, double confirm statistics accuracy
jim2) search box (in everywhere, eg. agent create new ticket) have awful view, try to make it looks good
jim3) Admin Manage Knowledgebase
(a) remove Agent Knowledgebase - Canned Responses
//(b) Knowledgebase Category Type - Featured: show on front-page, Public: readable by public, Private: only accessible by admins & agents
twh4) Admin Settings Ticket + Task, Alerts and Notices not done yet (emails) (make sure the variable must modified and follow my format in database, unless you found a better way)
//jim5) Remove Admin Manage Ticket Filters, Forms and Plugins; unless you want to keep these functions in agent page
twh6) Admin Emails - Emails info, Settings, Banlist; add logic/function to workable fields, give up/hide/delete/buang those unworkable fields
//7) Add a redirect button to user page in headerstaff and headeradmin, which is similar to agent login page one
//jim8) Some buttons in user welcome page not functional yet, eg. search button (delete) & featured questions, search box in user knowledgebase

Good luck and all the best :)
